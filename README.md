# MIXT
Fully-featured, highly customizable WordPress theme.

## Not actively maintained!
This was an ambitious project, originally sold on Themeforest. It was supposed to compete with the best multi-purpose WordPress themes at the time. After finally getting approved on TF, the sales were underwhelming and I decided to get a full-time job. Some time later I decided to pull it from TF as I didn't have time to keep up with support tickets, WordPress updates and the very frequent third-party and dependency updates. The theme has remained without updates since that time, some 3.5 years ago.

The theme still works for the most part, but there are some minor styling issues in the backend, and of course, the lack of updates. That being said, it is still a very complex and customizable theme, so feel free to browse the source or make use of it some other way.

I plan on bringing it up to date again in the future, but no firm roadmap yet.

### Third-party plugins
The Themeforest package contained Visual Composer and LayerSlider as well, however those were removed in order to freely distribute the theme and not break their licenses. The theme is compatible with both plugins (at least, Visual Composer 4.8.1 and LayerSlider 5.6.2), but they are no longer bundled in.
