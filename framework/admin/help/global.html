<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Site Layout</strong> - set the site's layout to wide or boxed. The layout cannot be boxed while the navbar layout is vertical. When set to boxed, more options will appear to control the background:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Background Color</strong> - solid color for the site background</li>
			<li><strong>Site Background</strong> - custom image for the background, with full control over properties like repeat, attachment, position and size</li>
			<li><strong>Background Pattern</strong> - set one of the included patterns as the site background. Will be ignored if "Site Background" is set</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Site Theme</strong> - the main, site-wide theme to use. Any element themes set to "Auto" will inherit this value.</li>
	<li><strong>Site Width</strong> - set the site width to a custom value, in pixels or as percentage</li>
	<li><strong>Responsive Layout</strong> - enable or disable responsive mode. If this is disabled, the site will be displayed in desktop mode on all screens.</li>
	<li><strong>Head Code</strong> - add any HTML code before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag of the page. Can be used, for example, to add JavaScript analytics code.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Page Loader</h5>
<p>All the options for the page loader are self-explanatory, no need to go into more detail.</p>
<h5>Modules</h5>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Icon Font Sets</strong> - select which icon font sets to load. Try to keep these to a minimum, as they can have a negative impact on load times.</li>
	<li><strong>Enable Themes</strong> - master switch for custom themes. If enabled, the "Themes" section will become available and you can manage your custom themes there.</li>
	<li><strong>Page Option Metaboxes</strong> - switch for enabling option metaboxes on pages and posts. These are used to override global options on specific pages.</li>
	<li><strong>BrowserSync Script</strong> - enable or disable the BrowserSync script for logged in admins. BrowserSync works in conjunction with the Gulp watch task to instantly update the CSS when changes are made without refreshing the page.</li>
</ul>
