<h5>Header Media</h5>
<p>The header media is a very versatile element that can be used to display all kinds of content and backgrounds. Content like the page or post info (the title and breadcrumbs) or custom HTML as well as shortcodes. It supports solid colors, images, videos and sliders as background.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fullscreen</strong> - enable this option to make the header element take up the entire screen height. Very useful for product presentations, a fullscreen slider, an introduction, and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Content Size</strong> - this option controls how the content inside the header will be displayed. "Normal" means the content will be padded and contained within the grid system, "Full Width" will be padded but stretch the whole width of the screen, and "Cover" will have no padding and overlay the whole header.</li>
	<li><strong>Content Fade Effect</strong> - this enables the neat fading effect for the header content. As the user scrolls down, the content will also scroll down at a slower speed and fade away once the user has scrolled down far enough.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Location Bar</h5>
<p>The "Location Bar" is the bar underneath the navbar or header which contains the page or post title and the navigation breadcrumbs. All options are self-explanatory, no need to go into more detail.</p>
