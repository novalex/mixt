<h5>Post Pages</h5>
<p>Post pages (or archive pages) are pages which display several posts, the most common of which is the blog page. Each of these pages has a separate section for complete control over their aspect. Also, every page besides the blog page can be set to inherit its options from the blog page.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pagination</strong> - select the type of pagination to use on post pages. "Classic" has previous and next buttons, "Numbered" has previous and next arrows and numbered buttons, "Ajax On Click" has a button that will load posts via Ajax when clicked and "Ajax On Scroll" is the same as the on click one but loads posts when the bottom of the page is reached and the button comes into view.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Posts</h5>
<P>This section contains options for the single post pages. Single posts can be styled differently than how they appear on archive pages. This allows for things like only displaying the post meta on the single post's page, and not also on the blog.</P>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Post Tags</strong> - show a list of buttons for the tags the post has at the bottom of the post. Clicking on any tag will take the user to a page containing all posts tagged that specific term.</li>
	<li><strong>Post Navigation</strong> - enable this to show buttons to the previous and next posts after the content. This can be especially useful if you have a series of posts where each one continues from the last.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Post Meta</h5>
<p>This section allows you to customize which meta information appears in the post meta element. Each component has a switch and an icon field (this can be left empty if you don't want icons to display. There is also a separator field if you want to use a special character to separate the meta components.</p>

<h5>Post Formats</h5>
<p>Here you can set the icon for each post format and type. Every field just takes the desired icon's class name(s), so no need to go into more detail.</p>

<h5>Social Sharing</h5>
<p>This is where you control the social aspects of your posts. There is a main switch to enable social sharing or not, and you can manage the profiles (or networks) that will show up in the sharing bar.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shorten URLs</strong> - enabling this will use the Bit.ly service to shorten URLs used as the {link2} tag. This is useful for networks like Twitter, which limit the number of characters a message can contain. A username and API key will be needed.</li>
	<li><strong>Share URL Tags</strong> -  to enable you to define any number of custom profiles, MIXT uses special tags in the "Share URL" field of the sharing profiles, which it then converts to data. A list of these tags is available below.

		<ul>
			<li><strong>{site}</strong> - the site's name</li>
			<li><strong>{title}</strong> - the post's title</li>
			<li><strong>{link}</strong> - the post's permalink</li>
			<li><strong>{link2}</strong> - the post's shortlink or Bit.ly shortened URL</li>
			<li><strong>{thumb}</strong> - the post's thumbnail image</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
