MIXT offers a powerful theming system for its elements, allowing you to create virtually limitless color combinations.<br>
You can customize every aspect of the element being themed, and will intelligently fill in the gaps when a field is left empty.<br><br>
Once you create your themes, you can select which one you want to use for a specific element in the options panel as well as on individual pages.

<h5>Common Fields</h5>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Theme Name</strong> - the name of the theme as it will appear in the theme select input</li>
	<li><strong>Theme ID</strong> - the theme&#39;s ID. It will be used in the element&#39;s theme class and in the generated CSS rules. For example, if the ID is &quot;aqua&quot;, the class name will be &quot;theme-aqua&quot;. If you set the ID to one already used by another theme, the first one will override the latter.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Navbar Themes</h5>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Background Color</strong> - color to use for the navbar background</li>
	<li><strong>Border Color</strong> - color to use for the navbar border</li>
	<li><strong>Text Color</strong> - color to use for the navbar text</li>
	<li><strong>Accent</strong> - color to use for hover and active states</li>
	<li><strong>Inverse Text &amp; Inverse Accent</strong> - colors to use when the navbar is transparent and the background behind it is of a different luminance than the navbar background color. For instance, if the navbar background color is white and the background behind it is black, the inverse text &amp; accent colors will be used while the navbar is transparent</li>
	<li><strong>Menu Background</strong> - color to use for the navbar dropdown menus&#39; background</li>
